            "text": "I've always had an interesting relationship with listening. The thing is, I am a perfectionist, and I've always thought that you should listen just right. You have to be focused, attentive, and detail-oriented. When at a concert, focus on the sounds as hard as possible, be present, be appreciative of the craft—immerse, immerse, immerse! Under no circumstances should you zone out. Don't let yourself get occupied by your thoughts. Grasp everything thoroughly, down to the bone. This way you can absorb the essence. Notice every nuance. Have your experience under control.\nIt was ironic—with that mindset, the only thing I was listening to most obediently was the voice in my head, urging me to listen, to stop thinking, to stay focused. Just as intellectualising emotions keeps you from truly feeling them, my rigid mindset made it hard to simply surrender to the sound, to let it wash over me before shaping it into thought. You can imagine that going to a concert felt more like a task, one where I had to embody the role of The Listener as perfectly as possible. More often than not, it ended in self-criticism and the sense that the whole experience had been wasted. I was aware that this was a result of my own mindset, one that backfired, but I didn't know how to stop. I would spiral, unable to pull myself out. I found myself caught in a storm of my own making. After all, listening is meant to be something natural. It shouldn't feel complicated. So is it really something that needs to be practised in order to improve? Is there something more to that?\nAccording to Pauline Oliveros, musician and composer, there's a fundamental distinction between hearing and listening, and that's where we should begin. Hearing is passive, involuntary; listening, on the other hand, is an active, conscious choice. This distinction forms the foundation of her practice of \"deep listening\", further enriched by her theory of \"quantum listening\". See, what illuminated me while reading her book was the notion of listening not just as a skill, but as a metaphysical presence, something constant and all-encompassing. \"Deep Listening involves going below the surface of what is heard, expanding to the whole field of sound while finding focus\", Oliveros notes. Listening, in this sense, isn't simply about you as a constant, with sound arriving from a particular direction—it's something far more fluid and interconnected. It includes you, those around you, the shared space between—all woven through with vibration. We are shaped by these waves, and we shape them in return. Through this premise, listening becomes a force with the potential to create kinship—a way to form reciprocal relationships with both the sound and also with fellow listeners.\nDeep listening is, however, a lifelong practice: it should be cultivated. I tried to nurture it during the Friday performances at Rewire, as a way to challenge my tendency to be the Perfect Listener. Because the truth is—as Oliveros would say—there's no such thing. As long as you're open to the possibilities that sound offers, willing to be transformed and to transform, you're already listening. I approached the entire experiment with a touch of cynicism. Open to trying, yet not expecting much. And yet, the outcome surprised me.\nI began the evening with COLIN STETSON's concert, sitting on the balcony. What struck me first wasn't the music, but the subtle shift in how I related to my own thoughts. And this time, I didn't push them away. Oliveros had said it clearly: deep listening includes your thoughts. So I let them in and began to observe my thoughts, listening to my own listening. The perspective that they were just as important as the external sounds, not distractions or something that took away from the experience, suddenly expanded the field of perception. I was listening on multiple levels at once. Suddenly, Oliveros's idea of quantum listening, of tuning into multiple realities at once, made perfect sense. I realised I was doing just that—holding more than one reality in my body. It thrilled me. I started to embrace the noise inside my head. I thought it was beautiful that I—that we—have the ability to listen not just outwards, but inwards, to be present in many places at once. I was excited to discover more.\nThe concerts by OKLOU and AYA sparked reflections on the relationship between sound and us—and between ourselves through sound. Interestingly, these thoughts, much like the music of OKLOU and AYA themselves, revolve around electronic music. I looked closely at how sound and audience exist in a continuous, interactive dynamic—how the presence and reactions of listeners become part of the sonic experience itself. During OKLOU's performance of HARVEST SKY, I spontaneously laughed with joy just as the crowd around me began to dance—not in unison, but in a shared, intuitive rhythm. In AYA's set, a man's persistent laughter gradually altered the atmosphere, merging into the performance itself. Suddenly, all the extra sounds stop feeling intrusive—once you realise how they intermingle with the artist's performance Suddenly—as Oliveros would say—everything becomes an improvisation. Listening is no longer defined solely by the music itself, but by the entire environment, by the collective presence that surrounds and transforms it.\nAgain, the theory from the book suddenly began to make sense—abstract words turned tangible, effortlessly applicable. Oliveros didn't offer a formula or step-by-step instructions on how to listen. Instead, she described the vast potential held within the sonic. And that was enough. It laid the foundation—not for perfect listening, but for beginning. For trying. For listening, deeply. It took just one evening for me to glimpse that potential for myself. Listening can be healing—in the simple act of accepting everything that there is, as it is. It can be humbling too, in the quiet recognition that you're not at the centre of it all, but rather a small part of a vast web of interconnectedness."

This distinction forms the foundation of her practice of \"deep listening\", further enriched by her theory of \"quantum listening\". See, what illuminated me while reading her book was the notion of listening not just as a skill, but as a metaphysical presence, something constant and all-encompassing. \"Deep Listening involves going below the surface of what is heard, expanding to the whole field of sound while finding focus\", Oliveros notes. Listening, in this sense, isn't simply about you as a constant, with sound arriving from a particular direction—it's something far more fluid and interconnected. It includes you, those around you, the shared space between—all woven through with vibration. We are shaped by these waves, and we shape them in return. Through this premise, listening becomes a force with the potential to create kinship—a way to form reciprocal relationships with both the sound and also with fellow listeners.\nDeep listening is, however, a lifelong practice: it should be cultivated. I tried to nurture it during the Friday performances at Rewire, as a way to challenge my tendency to be the Perfect Listener. Because the truth is—as Oliveros would say—there's no such thing. As long as you're open to the possibilities that sound offers, willing to be transformed and to transform, you're already listening. I approached the entire experiment with a touch of cynicism. Open to trying, yet not expecting much. And yet, the outcome surprised me.\nI began the evening with COLIN STETSON's concert, sitting on the balcony. What struck me first wasn't the music, but the subtle shift in how I related to my own thoughts. And this time, I didn't push them away. Oliveros had said it clearly: deep listening includes your thoughts. So I let them in and began to observe my thoughts, listening to my own listening. The perspective that they were just as important as the external sounds, not distractions or something that took away from the experience, suddenly expanded the field of perception. I was listening on multiple levels at once. Suddenly, Oliveros's idea of quantum listening, of tuning into multiple realities at once, made perfect sense. I realised I was doing just that—holding more than one reality in my body. It thrilled me. I started to embrace the noise inside my head. I thought it was beautiful that I—that we—have the ability to listen not just outwards, but inwards, to be present in many places at once. I was excited to discover more.\nThe concerts by OKLOU and AYA sparked reflections on the relationship between sound and us—and between ourselves through sound. Interestingly, these thoughts, much like the music of OKLOU and AYA themselves, revolve around electronic music. I looked closely at how sound and audience exist in a continuous, interactive dynamic—how the presence and reactions of listeners become part of the sonic experience itself. During OKLOU's performance of HARVEST SKY, I spontaneously laughed with joy just as the crowd around me began to dance—not in unison, but in a shared, intuitive rhythm. In AYA's set, a man's persistent laughter gradually altered the atmosphere, merging into the performance itself. Suddenly, all the extra sounds stop feeling intrusive—once you realise how they intermingle with the artist's performance Suddenly—as Oliveros would say—everything becomes an improvisation. Listening is no longer defined solely by the music itself, but by the entire environment, by the collective presence that surrounds and transforms it.\nAgain, the theory from the book suddenly began to make sense—abstract words turned tangible, effortlessly applicable. Oliveros didn't offer a formula or step-by-step instructions on how to listen. Instead, she described the vast potential held within the sonic. And that was enough. It laid the foundation—not for perfect listening, but for beginning. For trying. For listening, deeply. It took just one evening for me to glimpse that potential for myself. Listening can be healing—in the simple act of accepting everything that there is, as it is. It can be humbling too, in the quiet recognition that you're not at the centre of it all, but rather a small part of a vast web of interconnectedness."
